Moniepoint hackathon

Date: 22-02-2025

Intended Programming Language of Choice: Python

Steps: First, I would be building the model using Jupyter Notebook, convert to Python file, and then deploy using FastAPI
Run the API file on command prompt using: uvicorn moniepoint_api:app --reload. 
Afterwards, use this link to open the API on your web browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Task: To build analytics software that reads through transactionsâ€™ files and reports the following metrics:
1) Highest sales volume in a day
2) Highest sales value in a day
3) Most sold product ID by volume
4) Highest sales staff ID for each month.
5) Highest hour of the day by average transaction volume
