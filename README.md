# Moniepoint_hackathon

### Author: Oluwatimilehin Folarin

### Date: 22-02-2025

### Intended Programming Language of Choice: Python

### Task: 
To build analytics software that reads through transactionsâ€™ files and reports the following metrics:
1) Highest sales volume in a day
2) Highest sales value in a day
3) Most sold product ID by volume
4) Highest sales staff ID for each month.
5) Highest hour of the day by average transaction volume

### The Steps Taken: 
- First, I built the model using Jupyter Notebook, converted it to a Python file, and then deployed it using FastAPI
- Next, I ran the API file on the command prompt using this: uvicorn moniepoint_api:app --reload. 
- Afterward, I used this link to open the API on the web browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

### Note:
- The analytics Software was developed using Python.
- For online accessibility, an API was created using FastAPI, which the frontend developer can further work on for an improved user interface.
